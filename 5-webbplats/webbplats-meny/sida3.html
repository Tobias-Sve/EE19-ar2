            Growing up in New Jersey, Luke was involved with music at an early age. Learning how to play piano, electric guitar, and the drums were Luke’s first involvement with music and he did it all before 6th grade. With a move across country from New Jersey to Jackson, Wyoming, the distance between learning and playing new instruments got larger. It wasn’t until several years later Luke began to mess around with freestyling during his high school years spent at Jackson Hole High. Evolving his new found musical expression into writing detailed lyrics, he began to find that he could vent the stresses of everyday life through creating music.

            Trying to find his sound was a young teenager just looking to get something written down and then translated into music and eventually rap. Still in his caterpillar stage of metamorphosis was a young Abstract who released his first ever collection of songs, the properly named, The Dream.
