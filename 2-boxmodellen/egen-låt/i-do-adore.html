    <h1>
        I do adore - Mindy Gledhill
    </h1>
    <p>
        Everything you do it sends me<br>
        Higher than the moon with every<br>
        Twinkle in your eye<br>
        You strike a match that lights my heart on fire
    </p>

    <p>
        When you're near, I hide my blushing face<br>
        And trip on my shoelaces<br>
        Grace just isn't my forte<br>
        But it brings me to my knees when you say
    </p>

    <p>
        Hello, how are you, my darling today?<br>
        I fall into a pile on the floor<br>
        Puppy love is hard to ignore<br>
        When every little thing you do, I do adore
    </p>

    <p>
        Were as different as can be<br>
        I've noticed you're remarkably relaxed<br>
        And I'm overly uptight<br>
        We balance out each other nicely
    </p>

    <p>
        You wear sandals in the snow<br>
        In mid-July I still feel cold<br>
        Were opposites in every way<br>
        But I cant resist it when say
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>
        Finding words, I mutter<br>
        Tongue-tied, twisted<br>
        Foot in mouth, I start to stutter<br>
        Ha, ha, Heaven help me
    </p>
