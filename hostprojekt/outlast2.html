                        Outlast 2 is the sequel to the acclaimed survival horror game Outlast. Set in the same universe as
                        the first game, but with different characters and a different setting, Outlast 2 is a twisted new
                        journey into the depths of the human mind and its dark secrets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outlast 2 introduces you to Sullivan Knoth and his followers, who left our wicked world behind to
                        give birth to Temple Gate, a town, deep in the wilderness and hidden from civilization. Knoth and
                        his flock are preparing for the tribulations of the end of times and youâ€™re right in the thick of
                        it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You are Blake Langermann, a cameraman working with your wife, Lynn. The two of you are investigative
                        journalists willing to take risks and dig deep to uncover the stories no one else will dare touch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You're following a trail of clues that started with the seemingly impossible murder of a pregnant
                        woman known only as Jane Doe.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        The investigation has lead you miles into the Arizona desert, to a darkness so deep that no one
                        could shed light upon it, and a corruption so profound that going mad may be the only sane thing to
                        do.
