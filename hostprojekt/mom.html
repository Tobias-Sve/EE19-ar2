                        The main plot of Man of Medan is presented as an unfinished story in the possession of the omnipresent Curator (Pip Torrens), who requests the player's assistance in completing it. Decisions made by the player alter the outcome of the story and the fates of its characters.

                        The Curator's story centers on five individuals partaking in an underwater diving expedition to find a submerged WWII plane wreck in the South Pacific Ocean: brothers Alex (Kareem Alleyne) and Brad Smith (Chris Sandiford), Alex's girlfriend Julia (Arielle Palik), Julia's brother Conrad (Shawn Ashmore), and Félicité "Fliss" DuBois (Ayisha Issa), the captain of the group's dive boat. The expedition quickly turns dangerous, however, when the five are taken hostage by pirates Olson (Kwasi Songui), Junior (Chimwemwe Miller), and Danny (Russell Yuen).

                        Against their will, the group is brought to a large ghost ship – the fabled Indonesian Ourang Medan – where their worst nightmares become reality. With their safety threatened, their sanity tested, and their survival at stake, the five must make swift life-or-death choices that could either lead them to freedom or cause them to suffer fatal consequences.
