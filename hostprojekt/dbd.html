                        Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where one player takes on the role of the
                        savage Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and
                        avoid
                        being caught, tortured and killed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Survivors play in third-person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The
                        Killer
                        plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by
                        the
                        Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every
                        time
                        you play.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dead by Daylight has also had several cooperations with different horror franchises, for example Stranger Things, Silent Hill and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series.
